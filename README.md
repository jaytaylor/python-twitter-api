Update: 2012-04-30 I don't have time to maintain this separate fork anymore.  I will leave it available but if you have problems I would suggest using the python-twitter library from google code.


This project is a fork of http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/, with improvements and enhancements.

Features:
    -Automatically retrieve OAuth tokens programmatically, without the user having to visit Twitter.com
    -Improved control over request caching
    -Fixed cursor paging (though for now you'd have to use the poorly/confusingly named TwitterCache class to easily take advantage of full query sets)
